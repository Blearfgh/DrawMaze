# DrawMaze

DrawMaze is a small game I did on a course. The task was to make a game in a short period of time and I ended up making a game in which you have to navigate a ball though a maze using your cursor. The trick here is the fact that the ball keeps getting bigger in time.

If I ever get around to upgrade this game, I have decided to make the maps bigger and have the ball grow slower. Now the game is kinda hectic and there isn't much time look at the level when you start the game. Also graphics sure could use an update.
